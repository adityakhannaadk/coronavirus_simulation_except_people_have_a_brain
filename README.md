Coronavirus simulation except people actually have a brain.

Most simulations involve people randomly moving or a basic algorithm that decides their movement in correspondence to those around them. My model takes a different approach. I used a basic neural network for each "mover" on the simulation field to decide their next movement. I needed it to be basic to prevent computational complexity. This is still just a concept in its embryonic stage. I don't have a great amount of knowledge in epidemiology (though I find it interesting) this is just an idea I had.
